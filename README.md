# Maps-App

A maps-like app I created for my research project during my senior year of high school. It was created in mind of trying to solve a common problem that 
a lot of other people had. I tackled the issue of being able to both plan and get directions all in one app because I for one enjoy when everything is in
one spot instead of having to scrammble through multiple apps or websites. I felt as though the extra work of using multiple applications for a task such 
as planning out trips was too much, so I attempted to make it all in one. I implemented the code so that users can both plan out their trips, while also 
being able to use the app to get directions to a certain destination.
