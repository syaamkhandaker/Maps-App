# Maps-App
A maps-like app I created for my research project during my senior year of high school. It was created in mind of trying to solve a common problem that 
somoeone I knew had. I tackled the issue of being able to both plan and get directions all in one location. I felt as though the extra work of using
multiple applications for a task such as planning out trips was too much, so I attempted to make it all in one. Users can plan out their trips, while
also being able to use the app to get directions to a certain destination.
